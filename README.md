Let the past gone with the wind and look for a new-start!

Overview

Hi, darling! Have you watched Jojo Moyes's novel！

These soft and warm words have touched me! Hope these warm and full of sunshine
stroy can also left something in your heart! Today, I know that one's emotion is the most complex part in one's heart. Someone can fall love in
your heart regardless of your current age. You can like or admire someone regardless of their gender. The switch that opens the mind maybe 
just a glance, a short conversation, or an interesting song, movie, or a sport. What a wonderful world, and What a magical human being! 
Here, I want to record or present some thinkings and good memories that I never want to forgot. A slight regret is the normal in life! 
But you can follow your heart to do some interesting thing and spend a colorful life.
When I feel sad, I will remember the said that Will told Lou: 
“You’re going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too. Live boldly. Push yourself. Don’t settle. Just live well. Just live. Love, Will.”
Yeah, I should live boldly, push myself, do not settle, just live well, just live. One day, I also expect to sit beside the Champs Elysees, tast the coffee that Will loved, feel my L'Artisan Perfumeur. That must be the fantastic time!

Wish you can be treated kindly by the world and have a warm and moving life!

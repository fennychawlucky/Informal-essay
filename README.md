Let the past gone with the wind and look for a new-start!

Overview

Hi, darling! Have you watched Jojo Moyes's novel, Me Before YouÔºÅ

These soft and warm words have touched me! Hope these warm and full of sunshine
stroy can also left something in your heart! Today, I know that one's emotion is the most complex part in one's heart. Someone can fall love in
your heart regardless of your current age. You can like or admire someone regardless of their gender. The switch that opens the mind maybe 
just a glance, a short conversation, or an interesting song, movie, or a sport. What a wonderful world, and What a magical human being! 
Here, I want to record or present some thinkings and good memories that I never want to forgot. 

Wish you can be treated kindly by the world!

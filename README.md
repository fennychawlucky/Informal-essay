Let the past gone with the wind and look for a new-start!

Overview

Hi, darling! Have you read Jojo Moyes's novel！

These soft and warm words have touched me! Hope these warm and full of sunshine
stroy can also left something in your heart! Today, I know that one's emotion is the most complex part in one's heart. Someone can fall love in
your heart regardless of your current age. You can like or admire someone regardless of their gender. The switch that opens the mind maybe 
just a glance, a short conversation, or an interesting song, movie, or a sport. What a wonderful world, and What a magical human being! 
Here, I want to record or present some thinkings and good memories that I never want to forgot. A slight regret is the normal in life! 
But you can follow your heart to do some interesting thing and spend a colorful life.
When I feel sad, I will remember the said that Will told Lou: 
“You’re going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too. Live boldly. Push yourself. Don’t settle. Just live well. Just live. Love, Will.”
Yeah, I should live boldly, push myself, do not settle, just live well, just live. One day, I also expect to sit beside the Champs Elysees, tast the coffee that Will loved, feel my L'Artisan Perfumeur. That must be the fantastic time!

Wish you can be treated kindly by the world and have a warm and moving life!

Chapter1

A cool boy and a lovely girl met for the first time in a nice day! Then, a sweet story is slowly unfolding. 


The end!

We both have our road to spend. He is still a shining person, and She is still artistic and sensitive. Nobody can really enter her heart. To be honest, a sunning boy is her love maybe many years ago. The life is full of color, just pursue what really belongs to you!


--The Queen's Band is her favorite. Freddie Mercury's singing has accompanied her for many years, so she is not alone.

为什么随着历史长河的漂流，人类只要活着都要或多或少经历痛苦，迷茫和困惑。作家经历了什么痛苦能够如此敏锐的刻画出人物的心理变化过程。为什么远离了作家经历的时代，如今依然可以从他们的作品中发现一些共鸣。
为什么心情像过山车一样在同一天中经历个各种惊险的超重与失重感，悲伤与快乐，痛苦与冷静。人到底有什么样的调节机制，主宰着这一切。为什么人经历重重这种反差之后，人的心理依然有一定的韧性，依然可以顽强的活着，支撑着。
我很困惑。为什么到现在才体会到读抚慰自己心灵的书是陪伴自己的最好方式，也许真的到了某个年龄，达到了作者所处的状态。也许阅读他们的作品是越过这些煎熬时刻的最佳方式。

摘自网友：人生会失去很好的朋友和恋人，书却永远忠诚如一。
In this vacation, she has read two famous book. One is from an author, Dazai Osamu, who commited suicide after writen NO LONGER HUMAN. But what a pity, I haven't been in the same feeling in the protagonist. I met one elder brother, he told me that reading some philosophy and history rather than the psychological book. I think a little sensible and I was recommended the History of Western Philosophy from Bertrand Russell. And I was inspired by a book. So recently, I'm in this envrionment of reading.

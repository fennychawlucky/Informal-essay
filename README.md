Overview

Hi, darling! Have you read Jojo Moyes's novel！

These soft and warm words have touched me! Hope these warm and full of sunshine
stroy can also leave something in your heart! Today, I know that one's emotion is the most complex part of one's heart. Someone can fall love in
with your heart regardless of your current age. You can like or admire someone regardless of their gender. The switch that opens the mind may be just a glance, a short conversation, or an interesting song, movie, or a sport. What a wonderful world, and What a magical human being! 
Here, I want to record or present some thoughts and good memories that I never want to forget. A slight regret is the normal in life! 
But you can follow your heart to do some interesting things and have a colorful life.
When I feel sad, I will remember the said that Will told Lou: 
“You’re going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too. Live boldly. Push yourself. Don’t settle. Just live well. Just live. Love, Will.”
Yeah, I should live boldly, push myself, not settle, just live well, just live. One day, I also expect to sit beside the Champs Elysees, taste the coffee that Will loved, and feel my L'Artisan Perfumeur. That must be a fantastic time!

Wish you can be treated kindly by the world and have a warm and loving life!

#Chapter1
Love is marvelous, isn't it. 
No one knows what the relationship is between this boy and girl. Ok, let's say that it's more than friendship, but not love in lovers. Let's go to her heart to feel the most of truely feelings.

A cool boy and a lovely girl met for the first time on a nice day! Then, a sweet story is slowly unfolding. 
They have had a significant and marvelous time. What a surprise is that a quiet and introverted girl can play parkour and thrilling sports. In a night full of wind, they play the skate in a marked square. The girl showed the skating skills of all she learned. At this time, this boy learned the girl's mastered. After that, they try to learn other skills.

After a long time, there are some updates. The boy has lived in the girl's heart. All the honey times are valuable and unforgettable for the girl and she will never forget them.
Let's review this wonderful time together. The boy and girl had a great time on a summer night.
They took a walk and chatted along the beach, and even walked into a children's playground to play. That night was so happy.

The boy took the initiative to invite the girl to visit his home. In the boy's very interesting study, the girl had a happy evening. The books and all the decorations on the bookshelf made the girl feel novel and interesting, and she couldn't help but want to delve deeper into everything. They played chess, and both of them were tired because it was a very different way of playing. Haha, open the door to a new world. Later, they got tired and started listening to the music that the boy liked. The atmosphere of this night was wonderful. Time passed so quickly amidst the sound of classical and old pop music. Previously, the girl felt that the night was long, but this night, the girl felt that the night time was too short. As the night passed and the sky gradually brightened, the girl saw the first morning glow from the window, quietly enveloping the calm sea and high bridge in the distance. But the exploration of the girl's study is still not over because there are so many wonderful things. The girl read another photography book, and photography is one of the boy's biggest hobbies. The boy and girl quickly flipped through the original book's photography on the sofa, and the hand drawn pictures were the most interesting for the girl. After reading the book, they returned to the study. When the girl was flipping through another mythological storybook, in the morning, the boy suddenly hugged the girl. At this moment, the girl felt very unbelievable because she thought it couldn't happen between two people. But it's so familiar because the girl has always been psychologically fond of this boy, has a good impression, but is careful not to let the boy notice.

The boy taught the girl how to kiss the most emotionally and developed more diverse kisses, which the girl had never thought of. The girl doesn't know if the boy has the same heart and joy as herself, and feels the sweetness of love, but the girl knows she has fallen into this sweet love. Now, the girl feel like she is the most happiness woman in the world.
The end!

We both have our road to spend. He is still a shining person, and She is still artistic and sensitive. Nobody can really enter her heart for many years since middle school. To be honest, the sunning boy is her love maybe after many years. Life is full of color, just pursue what really belongs to you!

为什么随着历史长河的漂流，人类只要活着都要或多或少经历痛苦，迷茫和困惑。作家经历了什么痛苦能够如此敏锐的刻画出人物的心理变化过程。为什么远离了作家经历的时代，如今依然可以从他们的作品中发现一些共鸣。
为什么心情像过山车一样在同一天中经历个各种惊险的超重与失重感，悲伤与快乐，痛苦与冷静。人到底有什么样的调节机制，主宰着这一切。为什么人经历重重这种反差之后，人的心理依然有一定的韧性，依然可以顽强的活着，支撑着。
我很困惑。为什么到现在才体会到读抚慰自己心灵的书是陪伴自己的最好方式，也许真的到了某个年龄，达到了作者所处的状态。也许阅读他们的作品是越过这些煎熬时刻的最佳方式。

人类的情感很奇怪，有些人也许第一次见面就发现气场很契合，他们成为终生的朋友，但是有些人相见总是气氛尴尬，多看一眼就会厌烦，影响心情。是否真的有生命磁场这一说法。
高敏感的人是否真的容易受到外界影响？作家是否拥有非常细腻的情感，将生活中的感受与悲欢融入作品中，去塑造出各种个性鲜明的角色。
冷漠的人存在于世，她唯一的价值就是为作家提供坏人物的素材，在生活中冷漠带给人了无情的创伤。作家需要找到一种方法去忽略这种冷漠，忽略冷漠所带来的影响。

In this vacation, she has read two famous book. One is from an author, Dazai Osamu, who commited suicide after writen NO LONGER HUMAN. But what a pity, I haven't been in the same feeling in the protagonist. I met one elder brother, he told me that reading some philosophy and history rather than the psychological book. I think a little sensible and I was recommended the History of Western Philosophy from Bertrand Russell. And I was inspired by a book. So recently, I'm in this envrionment of reading.
